The bot is ideal for traders looking to reduce the amount of time spent on researching and analyzing the markets, as it can quickly scan for and identify the most profitable trades. 

My account less than $25K so I can't buy sell many time in a day, I use this way that I can trade many times on Tradovate


Everyday, can entry 2 orders and gain profit at leat 40%.

Cost to set up an options bot: a vps

My logic is simple and easy to auto trading on TDA.
